##########one table only available to make for reports#####
creating alias in physical layer
creating a  duplicate in bmm layer (make a primary key and corresponding subject area)
##look up table in general tab by double click on table

###############content logical level and prority to pick aggregate tables (elements)in hierarchy
No Of Elements Advantage TO PICK aggregrate tables
#####LEVEL BASED MEASURES #########
Nested AGG fun not supported by rpd so go for level based measures

#####CLASS 12 DEPLOYMENT############
Admin server controls em,console components
console activities-user,group creation and import and export of users
em  activities-
OBIS-RPD
OBIPS-ANALYTICS OR ANSWERS
OBIJH-GRAPHS
OBISCH-AGENT(SCHEDULER)
OBICC- ZERO DOWN TIME, PERFORMANCE

IF SERVER MACHINE IS 
LINUX--- ONLY CLIENT IS AVAILABLE
WINDOWS-- CLIENT AND SERVER BOTH ARE AVAILABLE
   
12C deployment of rpd in linux
1.close rpd to make sure everything is saved  
2.go to c:\oracle\middlewear\oracle_home\user_projects\do-mains\bi\bitools\bin -double click on start.sh (start.cmd)
3.downloadrpd -O RPDname [-W RPDpwd] -SI service_instance -U cred_username [-P cred_password] [-S hostname] [-N port_number] [-SSL] [-H]
4.uploadrpd -I <RPDname> [-W <RPDpwd>] -SI <service_instance> -U <cred_username> [-P <cred_password>] [-S <hostname>] [-N <port_number>] [-SSL] [-H]
if it client and server is on same machine upto password
if server is on another machine then hostname and portno
 5.http://demo.us.oracle.com:7780/analytics go here in chrome username pasword create a report to check the upload
done 
\Note: debugging OBIS
1. Go to below path
C:\Oracle\Middleware\Oracle_Home\user_projects\domains\bi\servers\obis1\logs
2. Open obis1-diagnostic.txt file and observe error message
   
$$$$$Less DOWNTIME IN 12C-DON'T need to restasrt the OBIS(Server)
##configuration file of OBIS- NQSCONFIG.ini (star= .rpdname)
##if error occur in OBIS SERVER (FAILED TO START UP) go to nqsserver-diagnostics\logs\orcbiservercomponent\coreappobis1\nqsserver.log(file)
$$11G installation 
simple--7001
enterprise-9704

###########online mode###########
latest changes will be updated if two users are working on rpd on same tables or same subject area
in 11g take the old rpd in repository make a new rpd copy from it and work it on that on offline and upload into rpd 

####Debugging log level######
############DEBBUGING LOG LEVEL######

1.go to em-diagnostics--serverlogs-fine (lock and edit apply activate changers start bi server)
GO to rpd in online mode
manage--identity--birepository--Action--search user filter--*--then users will apper-then set log level

default log level is 0
0-7 levels
manage-identity-log level-
##in dev and test we use log level 2
##in prod we use log level 0-as a developer we dont have acccess to debug log in prod(only for business users)
         to improve the performance diagnostics\logs\obiserver\coreappobis1\nq query(in backend)

########snow flake to star schema##########
checkout take an instance of object from obis
checkin pushed checkedout changes to obis
Reload server metadata gets updates from obips to obis
$add n number of physical tables to logical table source 
#################LTS############
to drag and drop physical columns to LTS we must have a direct join
converting snow flake schema to star schema
######calculations######
1.ETL SIDE -complex calculations which are reusable and taking more time
2.BMM layer-simple and reusable
3.Report level- simple and not reusable

BMM calculations
on logical colums -right click on logical column (before agg done)
on physicl columns -double click on LTS(source b/w logical tables and physical tables ,logical columns and physical columns is LTS)
NOTE:in phyisical layer level we dont have any aggregration rule (agg done after)
on calculation wizard- handling special cases null values and division by zero values
null value issue nvl(Null,value)
100/0 -error divisor is equal to zero

if logical coloumns are not available then only we use physical column calculations

#####while creation a report #########
max no of rows in 12c 5000001-- go to em business intelligence - bi instance -configuration-no of rows(cache management)
max no of rows in 11g 65000
obiee ifnull  || oracle nvl
#######substracting two date columns######
TIMESTAMPDIFF - diff in  months b/w dates sql_tsi_day,sql_tsi_month,sql_tsi_quarter,
TIMESTAMPADD  -add months to given date,last working day
to_char,To_date,to_number equal funtion in obiee  -casts

##########Evaluate functions#######calling database funtion directly from oracle bi analytics or RPD
three scenarios
1.database system defined funtion equivalent to obiee INSTR
2.user defined functions-TOTAlsal
3.To improve performance using directly database functions (system defined or user defined)
eg.instead of timestampdiff --- months_between
EVALUATE('INSTR(%1,%2)',NAME,'') -- space_function
EVALUATE('SUBSTR(%1,%2,%3)',ABCDEF,2,3) --nested evaluate functions EVALUATE('SUBSTR(%1,%2,%3)',NAME,1,space_function)
EVALUATE('NVL(%1,%2)',COMM,0)
EVALUATE('MONTHS_BETWEEN(%1,%2)',HIREDATE,REGDATE)

EVALUATE('INSTR(%1,%2)' ,  "Core"."Dim coustmers"."Name" ,' ')
Evaluate('SUBSTR(%1,%2,%3)',  "Core"."Dim coustmers"."Name",1,  "Core"."Dim coustmers"."Name_space_position" ) 
EVALUATE('NVL(%1,%2), COMM, 0)
Evaluate('SUBSTR(%1,%2,%3)',  "Core"."Dim coustmers"."Name" ,3,2) 


##########HIERARCHIES#########
CREATE hierarchies on dimension tables 
3 types
1.LEVEL BASED HIERARCHIES -one to many relationships among coloumns
2.PARENT CHILD HIERARCHIES
3.UN BALANCED HIERARCHIES (ragged and skipped)

Grand_total--year-quarter-month-day
grand_total--region-district-salesrep-coustmer
grand_total--type-subtype-generic--specific

Hierarchies are useful for 
1.Drilldown
2.drillaccross one hierarchy to other hierarchy( double click on day level -preffered drill path-region level)
double click on day level -- preffered drill path --then select region level--select
3.level based measures
4.aggregrate functions
5.time series measures
########no of elements at this level##########
region-district-salesrep-coustmer 1-1-1-1(no of elements at this level)
by row count we give hierarchy but tomorrow new data comes then need to update element(so not preffered method)
so go to ESTIMATE LEVELS if it works fine no problem if it  throws error then other method to do manually
there is no such rule to provide element level
always parent - child it should be increasing order 2-4-6-8 better option (top -bottom in increasing order)
ratio should be same 3:9:27:81  (1:3) as pre oracle document

why it is required???
the element will pick table/column has less no of data in live 
based on If same content logical level and priority available then it will pick the proper aggregrate table
takes this prperty help and decide which table i has to go(when data is in two tables)

##################LEVEL BASED MEASURES############
NESTED AGGREGATE FUNTIONS ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY RPD.HENCE LEARN LEVEL BASED MEASURES(NESTED AGGFUNCTINS SUM(SUM(DOLLARS))
REGIONWISE/TOTALMONEY * 100(CENTRAL ,EAST,WEST REGIONS)
duplicate dollars column
used to calculate shares or measures
make it as GRANDTOTAL in fact_sales
Drop it on coustmer-hierarchy grandtotal level
NOTE:Here a measure column is mapped with level is called as level based measure(we can also map it in 1 or more levels in some instances)
one measure column can be dropped on one level of hierarchy
if we want region level grand total ccreate one duplicate column of dollars and drag and drop it on region level hierarchy
similarly for any level of hierarchy create new measure column and drop it on particular level so it behaves like such level column

Region wise market share  ---dollars/sum(dollars)*100 (report level)
